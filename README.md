# Avocado Dashboard

Avocado dashboard made with plotly and dash.

I wanted to have a look into the possibilities of making a dashboard with python and came across plotly and dash. With a dataset of avocado prices, available at [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/neuromusic/avocado-prices), I made a simple interactive dashboard that shows the volume development for the US and volume and price development for the selected region. Also added some styling elements.
